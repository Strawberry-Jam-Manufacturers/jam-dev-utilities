        <h2>Free, Open Source & Ad-free</h2>
        <p>
          This free image resizer is a versatile tool that allows you to resize
          various image formats, including PNG, JPEG, and SVG. While PNG and
          JPEG images are pixel-based and can have their dimensions adjusted,
          SVGs are vector-based and can be scaled infinitely without losing
          quality. However, if you convert a PNG or JPEG to SVG using this tool,
          it will result in an SVG file that contains the image as Base64 data.
          This means the image will still be rasterized and can lose quality
          when resized. Whether you need to reduce file size, adjust dimensions,
          or convert formats, our tool can help. Made with ðŸ’œ by the developers
          building Jam.

        <h2>How to Use the Image Resizer</h2>
        <p>
          Resizing images with our online tool is simple and straightforward.
          Just upload your image, select the desired dimensions and format, and
          download the resized image. No signup required. Here's how:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Step 1:</b> <br /> Upload your image: Choose the image file you
            want to resize. Supported formats include PNG, JPEG, and SVG.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Step 2:</b> <br /> Select dimensions (for PNG/JPEG): Enter the
            width or height, and the tool will maintain the aspect ratio. For
            SVG, the image can be scaled as needed without losing quality.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Step 3:</b> <br /> Choose the format: Select between PNG, JPEG,
            or SVG. While PNG and JPEG are more common, SVG is a good choice if
            you want an image that can scale perfectly to any size. However, be
            aware that converting a PNG or JPEG to SVG will result in an SVG
            that embeds the image as Base64, which does not improve scalability
            or quality.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Step 4:</b> <br /> Download: Click the button to download the
            resized image.

        <h2>Benefits of Using an Image Resizer</h2>
        <p>
          Resizing images helps in optimizing their use across different
          platforms and devices. Whether you're a developer, designer, or
          content creator, resizing images can greatly enhance the performance
          and aesthetics of your work.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Performance:</b> <br /> Smaller image files load faster,
            improving website performance and user experience.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Compatibility:</b> <br /> Ensure your images fit perfectly on
            different screens and devices by adjusting their dimensions.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>File Size Reduction:</b> <br /> Reducing the dimensions can
            significantly decrease the file size without losing quality. This is
            particularly effective with PNG and JPEG formats.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>SVG Scalability:</b> <br /> SVG images are vector-based, meaning
            they can be scaled infinitely without losing quality. However,
            converting a PNG or JPEG to SVG results in an SVG that contains the
            image as Base64. This type of SVG will behave like a raster image
            and may lose quality when resized, similar to the original PNG or
            JPEG.

        <h2>FAQs</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>How does the image resizer maintain quality?</b> <br /> Our tool
            uses advanced algorithms to resize images while preserving their
            original quality, ensuring sharpness and clarity. For SVGs, the tool
            ensures that the vector quality is maintained at any size. However,
            if you convert a PNG or JPEG to SVG, the resulting SVG will embed
            the original image in Base64 format, which means it will behave like
            a raster image and may lose quality when resized.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>What formats are supported?</b> <br /> Currently, our tool
            supports PNG, JPEG, and SVG formats, which are the most commonly
            used image formats on the web.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Can I resize images to specific dimensions?</b> <br /> Yes, you
            can specify either the width or height, and the aspect ratio will be
            maintained automatically. This applies to both raster formats (PNG,
            JPEG) and vector formats (SVG).
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Is there a limit to the image size?</b> <br /> Our tool supports
            image files up to 4MB in size. This ensures quick processing and
            efficient performance. While SVGs are generally lightweight and can
            be resized quickly, PNG and JPEG images must also adhere to this
            size limit.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Is this tool free to use?</b> <br /> Yes, the image resizer is
            completely free to use, without any hidden costs or limitations.
