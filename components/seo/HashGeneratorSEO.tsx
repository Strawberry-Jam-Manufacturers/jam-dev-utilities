        <h2>How to Use the Hash Generator</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Input your text:</b> <br /> Enter the text you want to hash in
            the provided field.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Select the algorithm:</b> <br /> Choose from SHA-256, SHA-512,
            MD5, PBKDF2, or HMAC.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Optional parameters:</b> <br /> Depending on the algorithm, you
            can provide a salt, a secret key, or adjust the number of iterations
            and output length.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Generate the hash:</b> <br /> Click "Generate Hash" to get the
            resulting hash. You can then copy it to your clipboard.
          </li>

        <h2>Understanding Hashing Algorithms</h2>
        <p>
          Hash functions are mathematical algorithms that take an input (or
          'message') and return a fixed-size string of bytes. The output,
          typically referred to as a hash code, is unique to the provided input.
        </p>
        <p>
          Algorithms like SHA-256 and SHA-512 are part of the SHA-2 family,
          providing strong security for various applications. PBKDF2 is used to
          derive a cryptographic key from a password, providing an extra layer
          of security through multiple iterations.
        </p>
        <p>
          HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code) is another variant that
          uses a secret key to provide additional security, commonly used in
          secure communication protocols.
