        <p>
          Paste your text and copy the result. Works for Base64 to image, Base64

        <h2>Why Encode Data?</h2>
        <p>
          Base64 encoding converts binary data, such as images or files, into a
          text format that can be safely transmitted over text-based protocols
          like HTTP, email, and more. This process ensures that the data remains
          intact and prevents corruption during transmission.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Data Integrity:</b> <br /> Ensures that binary data, special
            characters, and non-ASCII symbols are correctly transmitted over the
            internet without corruption.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Data Embedding:</b> <br /> Allows embedding binary data within
            text-based formats like JSON, XML, and HTML, making it useful for
            web applications and APIs.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Compatibility:</b> <br /> Facilitates easier data sharing and
            exchange between different systems and platforms that handle
            text-based data.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Text to Binary Conversion:</b> <br /> Converts text strings to
            their original binary form, useful for handling encoded text data.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>ASCII Decoding:</b> <br /> Converts ASCII strings back to their
            original binary form, ensuring accurate data reconstruction.
          </li>

        <h2>Using Base64 in JavaScript:</h2>
        <p>
          In JavaScript, Base64 encoding and decoding can be done using the
          built-in <kbd>btoa</kbd> and <kbd>atob</kbd> functions.
        </p>
        <CodeExample>{b64codeExample}</CodeExample>
        <p>
          These functions make it easy to handle encoding and decoding directly
          within your JavaScript code, enabling smooth data processing and
          transmission in web applications.
